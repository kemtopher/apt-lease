            <h3 class="sub-heading">1.2 Insurance Requirements</h3>
            <p>Tenant insurance, also known as renter's insurance, is a type of insurance policy that provides protection for a tenant's personal property and liability in a rented property. As a tenant, you are required to purchase renter's insurance to protect your personal belongings while residing in the leased premises.</p>

            <ul class="bulletless-list">
              <h4>Here's a breakdown of what this typically means:</h4>
              <li>
                <h5 class="li-title">Personal Property Coverage:</h5>
                <p>Renter's insurance provides coverage for your personal belongings such as furniture, clothing, electronics, and other possessions. If they are damaged or destroyed due to covered perils, your insurance policy will help you replace or repair them.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5 class="li-title">Liability Coverage:</h5>
                <p>Renter's insurance often includes liability coverage, which can protect you if you are found legally responsible for causing damage to the rental property or if someone is injured on the property due to your negligence. This coverage can help pay for legal fees and damages.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5 class="li-title">Common Areas Coverage:</h5>
                <p>The guideline you provided also mentions coverage for personal property in common areas. This typically means that if your personal belongings are stolen or damaged in areas shared by multiple tenants (e.g., a common laundry room, hallway, or lobby), your renter's insurance can help cover the losses.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5 class="li-title">Damages:</h5>
                <p>The guideline states that your renter's insurance should protect your personal property from "any and all damages." This means your policy should cover a wide range of perils, including fire, theft, vandalism, water damage, and more. Be sure to review your policy to understand what specific perils are covered.</p>
              </li>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">1.3 Security Deposit</h3>
            <p>The security deposit is collected to protect the landlord from financial losses caused by unpaid rent, damage beyond normal wear and tear, cleaning costs, and any other breaches of the lease agreement.</p>
            <ul class="bulletless-list">
              <li>
                <h4>Use of the Security Deposit:</h4>
                <p class="sub-head">The security deposit may be used for the following purposes:</p>
                <ul class="inner-list">
                  <li>Unpaid rent or fees as specified in the lease agreement.</li>
                  <li>Repairing damages to the property that go beyond normal wear and tear.</li>
                  <li>Cleaning costs necessary to restore the property to its original condition.</li>

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Inspection and Documentation:</h4>
                <p>A move-in inspection should be conducted by the tenant to document the condition of the property. Tenants are encouraged to thoroughly document any pre-existing damage or issues.</p>

              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Interest:</h4>
                <p>The security deposit will be held in a bank account by landlord. 1% per year interest will be credited toward deposit return amount.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Return of the Deposit:</h4>
                <p>The security deposit, less any allowable deductions, will be returned to the tenant within 21 days after the termination of the lease and after the move-out inspection, as required by State law.</p>

                <h5 class="li-title">Documenting Initial Condition:</h5>
                <p>Before moving in, tenants should conduct a thorough walkthrough of the property, room by room. Take clear photos of any existing issues or concerns, such as damaged fixtures, stains, or areas in need of cleaning. Timestamp the photos to establish when they were taken.</p>

                <p>When requesting repairs, tenants should take photos that clearly show the issue and any related damage. Provide a brief written description of the problem along with the photos. Send the photos and repair request to the landlord or property management through the preferred communication method (e.g., email, text message, or a designated maintenance request portal).</p>

                <h5 class="li-title">Maintain Clear Communication:</h5>
                <p>Be courteous and respectful when communicating with the landlord or property management about repairs. Use photos as a visual aid to make it easier for them to understand the issue. Be clear about the urgency of the repair (e.g., whether it's an emergency or a non-urgent issue).</p>

            <p>As part of your lease agreement, the landlord will provide you with a pool key at move-in if the property is part of an HOA with a pool facility. This key will grant you access to the pool area. Understand that the pool key provided to you is your responsibility. Keep it secure and do not lose it. If you lose the pool key, there is a $50 charge for its replacement.</p>

              <li>
                <h5 class="li-title">Prohibition of Glass Containers:</h5>
                <p>Understand that one of the most important rules is the prohibition of glass containers in the pool area. Be aware that if glass is broken in the pool area, you may be held responsible for the associated expenses, which can include draining, cleaning, and re-filling the pool. This can be a significant financial burden, so it is essential to exercise caution and adhere to the no glass containers rule.</p>

                <p>The United States Postal Service (USPS) typically does not want landlords to be directly involved with tenants' mailboxes or mailbox keys. Landlords often provide mailbox keys to tenants as a convenience, but it's ultimately the tenants' choice whether they want to pay the fees associated with getting new keys issued.</p>

              <p>It's essential for tenants to maintain good relationships with their neighbors by being considerate when it comes to parking. If the garage can accommodate two cars, and the tenants own 3 cars, one car may be parked directly in front of the garage. Only one car is typically allowed to be parked outside of the garage. Guest parking is typically reserved for guests. Tenants should be mindful of these guidelines.</p>

                <h5 class="li-title">Holes are Considered Damages:</h5>
                <p>Creating holes in the walls of a rental property is considered damages because they need to be repaired when the tenant leaves. Typically, tenants reside in a rental for 2 to 3 years, and multiple tenants drilling holes in the walls over time can result in a deteriorated wall appearance.</p>

                <p>A key aspect of maintaining a property's clean and new look is ensuring that the walls remain smooth and well-textured. Repairing holes in the walls is relatively straightforward, but it is challenging to restore the proper wall texture. It is not feasible to replace drywall due to the interconnected nature of walls, trim, and ceilings.</p>

                <p>If a tenant is dealing with mice, it's likely that actions are inadvertently attracting them. Leaving dirty dishes piled up with food on them or keeping a bowl of pet food on the floor can almost certainly invite mice into the living space.</p>

                <p>When faced with a mouse issue, the first step for the tenant should be identifying what is attracting these rodents and promptly removing the source.</p>

              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Locate Entry Points:</h5>
                <p>Following that, efforts should be made to determine where the mice are entering the premises and, if possible, take steps to seal off those entry points. For instance, if the garage door is frequently left open in cold weather, mice may enter unnoticed.</p>
              </li>
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Sealing Entry Points:</h5>
                <p>If there are gaps or holes in the property that facilitate pest entry, it becomes the landlord's responsibility to address these issues. Tenants are encouraged to identify such entry points and communicate them to the landlord for necessary repairs.</p>
              </li>
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Tenant Initiative:</h5>
                <p>In cases where immediate action is required to control the mouse problem, tenants may consider a visit to the hardware store to purchase traps or repellents. With the landlord's approval, tenants can deduct these expenses from their rent as part of the solution.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This approach empowers tenants to take proactive steps in dealing with mice while emphasizing communication with the landlord for a coordinated resolution.</p>

                  <p>The primary issue with garage door openers often revolves around the alignment of the sensors, which is crucial for the door to close safely. Tenants are responsible for keeping their garage door sensors aligned.</p>
                  <p>To align the garage door sensors, pay attention to the indicator lights on them. Adjust them so that the light is steady and not blinking.</p>
                  <p>It's common for the sensors to get bumped when moving garbage cans in and out of the garage. When the sensors aren't properly aligned, the garage door opener will initially attempt to close the door but then stop and blink the light about 10 times.</p>
                  <p>If you encounter problems with the sensors, it's possible to override them by holding down the hardwired button for the garage door opener, usually located in the garage on the wall next to the door leading into the house. Keeping this button pressed throughout the door's operation will ensure that it closes, bypassing the sensor issue.</p>

            <p>Front-loading washing machines have become popular for several reasons, but they do come with their own set of considerations and potential issues. Here's some information to keep in mind:</p>
            <ul class="bulletless-list">
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Seal Maintenance:</h5>
                  <p>Front-loading machines require regular maintenance of the door seal. This seal can accumulate lint, hair, and dirt over time, which may lead to unpleasant odors and even leaks if not cleaned and maintained properly. Regularly wiping down the seal can help prevent these issues.</p>
              </li>
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Balancing Challenges:</h5>
                <p>Front-loading machines can be more sensitive to balance issues than top-loading ones. The use of heavy concrete castings bolted to the drum attempts to address this challenge. But this makes the washers extremely heavy, compared to a top loader.</p>
              </li>
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Main Bearing:</h5>
                <p>The main bearing in the back of front-loading machines can be subjected to wear and tear, especially when overloaded. If the bearing fails, it can be a costly repair, potentially approaching the cost of a new unit.</p>
              </li>
              <h5 class="li-title">Fabric Softener:</h5>
              <p>Fabric softener can indeed contribute to the buildup of residues in the machine, particularly in front-loading models. It's best not to use these strange chemicals.</p>
            </li>
            <li>                
              <h5 class="li-title">Bad Smells:</h5>
              <p>It is best to leave the door open after running a load to allow the inside the dry out and prevent mustiness. Top loaders have an air gap that provides this function. Front loaders have to be sealed since gravity is not helping.</p>

            <ul class="bulletless-list">
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Ensure Clothes Are Spun:</h5>
                  <p>Before placing clothes in the dryer, make sure they have undergone a proper spin cycle in the washing machine. This step helps remove excess water, ensuring efficient drying and preventing damage to the dryer.</p>
              </li>
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Proper Loading: </h5>
                <p>Avoid overloading the dryer. Clothes need space to tumble freely, allowing hot air to circulate evenly. Overloading can lead to uneven drying and longer drying times.</p>
              </li>
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Fabric Softener and Dryer Sheets:</h5>
                <p>Using fabric softener and dryer sheets can leave residues on clothes and in the dryer. These residues may create a water-repelling effect on the dryer screen. It's best to not use these products and consider alternative methods to achieve desired softness or freshness.</p>
              </li>
              <h5 class="li-title">Cleaning the Dryer Screen: </h5>
                <p>Periodically remove and clean the lint screen in your dryer. Lint buildup on the screen can reduce airflow and efficiency. Additionally, inspect the screen for any unusual coatings or residues that may affect its performance. If you notice anything unusual, clean it thoroughly.</p>
                <p>Maintaining your dryer and following these guidelines can help ensure that your clothes are dried effectively, prevent potential damage to the dryer, and maintain its efficiency.</p>

                  <p>The landlord is responsible for regularly replacing or cleaning HVAC filters. If the tenant prefers to do this, it is suggested to buy MERV3 filters from Menards. The purpose of the air filter is to keep dust from caking on the furnace blower wheel and inner parts. The cheapo MERV1 filters will not protect the blower.</p>
                  <p>Higher MERV ratings cause the following:</p>
                  <ul class="inner-list">
                    <li>A greater load on the blower motor and increased electric bills.</li>

                  <p>If you encounter issues with your heating or air conditioning systems, please call your landlord. The companies who install and service HVAC systems like to place stickers with their phone numbers on them all over the utility room. Please do not call these phone numbers. By notifying your landlord, this helps streamline the maintenance process and ensures that the necessary repairs or servicing are carried out efficiently.</p>

              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Indoor Air Quality:</h5>
                  <p>The marketing departments of 3M and Honeywell have succeeded in convincing people they need fancy and expensive air filters. I have a 5 band particle counter and have run many tests. I have determined that the filter on your HVAC system is NOT effective at controlling air quality in the whole house.</p>
                  <p>If indoor air quality is important, by far the 2 biggest factors are:</p>
                  <ul class="inner-list">
                    <li>Keep your house swept and vacuumed. Floors and upholstered furniture. Sitting down on the couch is like setting off a particulate bomb.</li>
                    <li>Keep your windows closed. Outside air in a city with vehicles is the source of the most harmful particle size of 3-5 micron. Outside levels are 10 to 100 times higher than indoor levels.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Cottonwood Fuzz:</h5>
                  <p>Cottonwood fuzz can clog the outdoor heat exchanger of the air conditioner. When this happens, the pressure inside of the refrigerant lines becomes excessive and will cause a rupture and typically a catastrophic failure. Please shut off your air conditioning and notify the landlord if it does not seem to be cooling effectively or if it is running continuously.</p>
              </li>
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Thermostat Settings:</h5>
                <p>Avoid setting the thermostat too low in the summer. A moderate temperature setting (around 78°F or 26°C) is energy-efficient and comfortable. Extreme settings can strain the system and lead to higher utility bills.</p>
                <p>Set the thermostat at a moderate, energy-efficient temperature during the heating season (around 68-72°F or 20-22°C). Avoid extreme temperature settings that can strain the system and increase heating costs.</p>
              </li>
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Energy Conservation:</h5>
                  <p>Practice energy conservation by turning off the air conditioning when you're not at home. Use programmable thermostats if available to automate temperature adjustments. During hot, sunny days, keep windows and curtains closed to block out direct sunlight and heat.</p>

                <p>Tenants are responsible for replacing burned out light bulbs.</p>
              </li>
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Energy Efficiency:</h5>
                <p>LED lightbulbs are indeed remarkable due to their energy efficiency, consuming only a fraction of the electricity compared to old incandescent bulbs. Please only replace with LED lighting. This can result in significant energy savings over time.</p>
              </li>
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Shopping Tips:</h5>
                <p>It's worth noting that the prices of LED bulbs can vary from store to store. Some retailers may charge higher prices for LED bulbs, so it's a good idea to shop around. Stores like Menards and Home Depot often offer competitive prices on LED bulbs, making them accessible to a wide range of consumers.</p>
              </li>
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Color Temperature Consideration:</h5>
                <p>Another important aspect to consider when choosing LED bulbs is the color temperature of the light they emit. LED bulbs come in various color temperatures, which are typically measured in Kelvins (K). Warmer color temperatures (e.g., 2700K) emit a softer, more yellowish light, resembling traditional incandescent bulbs. Cooler color temperatures (e.g., 5000K) emit a brighter, bluish-white light.</p>
                <p>To achieve consistent lighting in a room, it's advisable to replace all the bulbs in a particular fixture with bulbs of the same color temperature. This ensures that the lighting ambiance remains consistent and harmonious throughout the space.</p>

                <h5 class="li-title">Check for Leaks:</h5>
                <p>Since utility rooms often house water heaters, washers, and other water-related appliances, regularly inspect for leaks or water damage.</p>

                <h5 class="li-title">Routine Cleaning:</h5>
                <p>Tenants should regularly clean the vinyl plank flooring using a broom or vacuum cleaner with a soft brush attachment to remove dust and debris. For routine cleaning, use a damp mop with warm water and a mild, pH-neutral cleaner designed for vinyl flooring.</p>
              </li>
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Furniture Protection:</h5>
                <p>Place felt pads or furniture coasters under the legs of heavy furniture to prevent indentations or scratches on the flooring. Regularly check and replace these protective pads as needed.</p>
              </li>
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Avoid Sharp Objects:</h5>
                <p>Protect the floor when moving all items across the floor including appliances. Carry items on to and off of hardwood surfaces. Never drag an item across the surface and avoid use of carts as dirt on wheels can scratch the hardwood surface.</p>
              </li>
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Mats and Rugs:</h5>
                <p>Place mats or rugs at entryways and high-traffic areas to capture dirt and prevent it from being tracked onto the vinyl plank flooring. Ensure that mats have non-slip backings to prevent accidents.</p>
              </li>
              <li>                
                <h5 class="li-title">Avoid Rubber and Foam Backings:</h5>
                <p>Do not use mats or rugs with rubber or foam backings, as these materials can discolor or damage the vinyl surface over time. Avoid mats with rubber or other dense backings that will block airflow beneath rugs or might retain abrasives and humidity.</p>
                <p>By following these guidelines, tenants can help ensure the longevity and appearance of vinyl plank flooring, promoting a pleasant and well-maintained living environment. Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in financial responsibility for repair or replacement costs.</p>

              <li>
                <h5 class="li-title">Tenant Responsibility - Battery Replacement:</h5>
                <p>Tenants are responsible for replacing the smoke detector batteries</p>
                <p>When your smoke alarm emits a chirping sound, it's a clear signal that the battery needs replacement. It's essential to take action promptly and replace the battery; simply removing the alarm is not a solution.</p>

              <li>
                <h5 class="li-title">Landlord Responsibility - Detector Replacement:</h5>
                <p>Carbon monoxide sensors have a typical lifespan of around five years. Even if you install a fresh battery, they may continue to chirp when it's time for replacement. In such cases, it's crucial to contact your landlord for a replacement sensor.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5 class="li-title">Important Safety Precautions:</h5>
                <p>If your carbon monoxide detector goes off, it indicates a potentially serious condition. The first step is to open a window for ventilation and quickly attempt to identify the source. Often, it's related to automotive exhaust, such as someone idling their car nearby.</p>
                <p>If you can't readily identify or resolve the source of the carbon monoxide, stay outside where there's fresh air and contact your landlord immediately.</p>
                <p>Additionally, it's essential to emphasize: NEVER start your car and let it warm up in a closed garage with the garage door down. This practice can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning and is extremely hazardous. Tenants, especially those from warmer climates, need to be aware of this life-threatening risk to ensure their safety.</p>

                <p>With landlord approval, leases can usually be extended into the summer. However, once school starts, we enter the off-season. During the off season, it can be difficult to find good renters. Therefore new lease needs to be signed until the spring.</p>

                <p>If the Tenant holds over with the written consent of the Landlord, the lease becomes a month-to-month agreement, with the rental rate set at the last month's rate of the original lease. All other terms and provisions of the original lease remain in effect. Either party can terminate this month-to-month lease by providing sixty (60) days of written notice to the other party.</p>

Holding over by the Tenant does not extend the lease period beyond its original term. In the case of unauthorized holding over, the Tenant is liable for any damages incurred by other tenants to whom the Landlord may have leased the premises after the termination of this lease.</p>

                <h5 class="li-title">Repair Any Damage:</h5>
                <p>Repair or address any damages beyond normal wear and tear. Tenants are responsible for lost rent while making the property suitable for the next tenant.

                <h5 class="li-title">Cancel Utilities and Services:</h5>

                <h5 class="li-title">Take Photos:</h5>
                <p>Before you leave, take photos of the rental unit's condition to document its state at move-out. These photos can serve as evidence in case of disputes.</p>
