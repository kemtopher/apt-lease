Before Moving In</h2><hr/><div id="sec1.1" class="body section-part"><h3 class="sub-heading">1.1 Contact Information and Payment Information</h3><p>Welcome to your new home! We are delighted to have you as a tenant and want to ensure that your move-in process is as smooth and hassle-free as possible. This handbook contains important information and guidelines to help you settle into your new home comfortably.</p><p>Rent shall be made payable to John Grottodden and mailed or delivered to the following address:<br>561 Lakeridge Ct,<br>Shoreview, MN 55126</p><p>Payment to grottodden@gmail.com using Zelle is preferred.<br>Venmo to @John-Grottodden is preferred.</p><p>These methods eliminate the hassle of lost or stolen checks.<br>Landlord is not responsible for lost or stolen checks..</p></div><div id="sec1.2" class="body section-part"><h3 class="sub-heading">1.2 Insurance Requirements</h3><p>Tenant insurance, also known as renter's insurance, is a type of insurance policy that provides protection for a tenant's personal property and liability in a rented property. As a tenant, you are required to purchase renter's insurance to protect your personal belongings while residing in the leased premises.</p><ul class="bulletless-list"><h4>Here's a breakdown of what this typically means:</h4><li><h5 class="li-title">Personal Property Coverage:</h5><p>Renter's insurance provides coverage for your personal belongings such as furniture, clothing, electronics, and other possessions. If they are damaged or destroyed due to covered perils, your insurance policy will help you replace or repair them.</p></li><li><h5 class="li-title">Liability Coverage:</h5><p>Renter's insurance often includes liability coverage, which can protect you if you are found legally responsible for causing damage to the rental property or if someone is injured on the property due to your negligence. This coverage can help pay for legal fees and damages.</p></li><li><h5 class="li-title">Common Areas Coverage:</h5><p>The guideline you provided also mentions coverage for personal property in common areas. This typically means that if your personal belongings are stolen or damaged in areas shared by multiple tenants (e.g., a common laundry room, hallway, or lobby), your renter's insurance can help cover the losses.</p></li><li><h5 class="li-title">Damages:</h5><p>The guideline states that your renter's insurance should protect your personal property from "any and all damages." This means your policy should cover a wide range of perils, including fire, theft, vandalism, water damage, and more. Be sure to review your policy to understand what specific perils are covered.</p></li></ul></div><div id="sec1.3" class="body section-part"><h3 class="sub-heading">1.3 Security Deposit</h3><p>The security deposit is collected to protect the landlord from financial losses caused by unpaid rent, damage beyond normal wear and tear, cleaning costs, and any other breaches of the lease agreement.</p><ul class="bulletless-list"><li><h4>Use of the Security Deposit:</h4><p class="sub-head">The security deposit may be used for the following purposes:</p><ul class="inner-list"><li>Unpaid rent or fees as specified in the lease agreement.</li><li>Repairing damages to the property that go beyond normal wear and tear.</li><li>Cleaning costs necessary to restore the property to its original condition.</li><li>Any other amounts owed by the tenant as specified in the lease agreement.</li></ul></li><li><h4>Inspection and Documentation:</h4><p>A move-in inspection should be conducted by the tenant to document the condition of the property. Tenants are encouraged to thoroughly document any pre-existing damage or issues.</p><p>Here is a link to a damage tracker website where you can document your issues and invite your landlord to track them. <a href="/">link to damage tracker website</a></p></li><li><h4>Interest:</h4><p>The security deposit will be held in a bank account by landlord. 1% per year interest will be credited toward deposit return amount.</p></li><li><h4>Return of the Deposit:</h4><p>The security deposit, less any allowable deductions, will be returned to the tenant within 21 days after the termination of the lease and after the move-out inspection, as required by State law.</p></li></ul></div></section><section id="sec2" class="section section-main"><div class="section-image short"><img src="./img/apt-tour.jpg"/></div><h2 class="heading">2. Move-In Day</h2><p>Welcome to your new home! We want your move-in process to be smooth and hassle-free. Here are some guidelines to help you get settled:</p><hr/><div id="sec2.1" class="body section-part"><h3 class="sub-heading">2.1 Move-in Inspection Process</h3><ul class="bulletless-list"><li><h5 class="li-title">Documenting Initial Condition:</h5><p>Before moving in, tenants should conduct a thorough walkthrough of the property, room by room. Take clear photos of any existing issues or concerns, such as damaged fixtures, stains, or areas in need of cleaning. Timestamp the photos to establish when they were taken.</p><p>Here is a link to a damage tracker website where you can document your issues and invite your landlord to track them. LINK: link to damage tracker website</p></li><li><h5 class="li-title">Requesting Repairs:</h5><p>When requesting repairs, tenants should take photos that clearly show the issue and any related damage. Provide a brief written description of the problem along with the photos. Send the photos and repair request to the landlord or property management through the preferred communication method (e.g., email, text message, or a designated maintenance request portal).</p><p>Here is a link to a damage tracker website where you can document your issues and invite your landlord to track them. LINK: link to damage tracker website</p></li><li><h5 class="li-title">Maintain Clear Communication:</h5><p>Be courteous and respectful when communicating with the landlord or property management about repairs. Use photos as a visual aid to make it easier for them to understand the issue. Be clear about the urgency of the repair (e.g., whether it's an emergency or a non-urgent issue).</p></li></ul></div><div id="sec1.2" class="body section-part"><h3 class="sub-heading">2.2 Residence Keys</h3><ul class="bulletless-list"><li><h5 class="li-title">Key Provision at Move-In:</h5><p>The landlord will provide door keys and garage door opener remotes at move-in. Additional keys may be requested.</p></li><li><h5 class="li-title">Lock Changes and Additions:</h5><p>Recognize that the lease agreement prohibits changing or adding locks without the landlord's prior written consent. This rule is typically in place to maintain key control of the rental property.</p></li><li><h5 class="li-title">Return of Keys at Lease Termination or Move-Out:</h5><p>At the end of your lease term or upon moving out of the rental property, you are required to return all keys provided by the landlord. This includes any additional keys that were issued during your tenancy.</p></li></ul></div><div id="sec1.3" class="body section-part"><h3 class="sub-heading">2.3 Pool Keys</h3><p>As part of your lease agreement, the landlord will provide you with a pool key at move-in if the property is part of an HOA with a pool facility. This key will grant you access to the pool area. Understand that the pool key provided to you is your responsibility. Keep it secure and do not lose it. If you lose the pool key, there is a $50 charge for its replacement.</p><ul class="bulletless-list"><li><h5 class="li-title">Pool Rules and HOA Rules:</h5><p>During the lease signing process, the landlord will provide you with a copy of the pool rules in addition to the HOA Rules. Failure to follow these rules may result in the loss of pool access and potentially other consequences.</p></li><li><h5 class="li-title">Prohibition of Glass Containers:</h5><p>Understand that one of the most important rules is the prohibition of glass containers in the pool area. Be aware that if glass is broken in the pool area, you may be held responsible for the associated expenses, which can include draining, cleaning, and re-filling the pool. This can be a significant financial burden, so it is essential to exercise caution and adhere to the no glass containers rule.</p></li></ul></div></section><footer><div class="footer-wrapper"></div></footer></div></div></main></body></html>
